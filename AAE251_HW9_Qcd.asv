%% Initializations

alt = linspace(0,30,30/100+1);  % Altitude array [km]
thrustAvailable = [];            % Initialized available power array [kW]
thrustRequired = [];             % Initialized required power array [kN]

rhoSea = 1.2250;        % Density at sea level [kg/m^3]
g = 9.81;               % Gravitational acceleration [m/s^2]
m = 33100;                   % Mass of the aircraft [kg]
mAD = 0.6;                 % Air density exponent
thrustMax = 55620;           % Maximum available thrust at sea level [kN]
K = 0.05;               % Wingspan efficien
aspectRatio = ;         % Aspect ratio of wing
parasiteDrag = 0.015;        % Parasitic drag


%% Calculations

for i = 1:length(alt)
    [~,~,~,rhoAlt] = atmosisa(alt(i)*1000, extended="on");

    thrustAvailable(i) = ((rhoAlt/rhoSea)^mAD)*thrustMax;
    thrustRequired(i) = 2*m*g*sqrt(K*parasiteDrag);
end
